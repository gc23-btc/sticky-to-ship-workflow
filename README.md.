# Sticky-to-Ship Workflow

This repository provides a starter pack for the Sticky to Ship product development workflow. It includes docs, prompt templates, scripts, and configuration files to help you go from raw ideas to shipped products.

## Structure

- `docs/` – planning documents and templates (master playbook, one‑pager, changelog).
- `prompts/` – AI prompt packs and agent definitions (e.g. Lindy agent).
- `scripts/` – setup scripts for bootstrapping a project (`.sh` and `.ps1`).
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` – GitHub issue templates (feature request).
- `.env.example` – Example environment variables you should copy to `.env.local`.
- `.gitignore` – Files and directories that should not be committed.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository and navigate into the folder.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your environment variables.
3. Use the setup scripts to initialize a Next.js project:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/setup_repo.sh my-project
   ```

   On Windows use PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   .\scripts\setup_repo.ps1 -ProjectName "my-project"
   ```

4. Follow the master playbook in `docs/master-playbook.md` to run the Sticky‑to‑Ship workflow for your idea.

## Resources

- `docs/one-pager-template.md` – Template to capture and expand new ideas.
- `prompts/lindy-agent-prompt.json` – Lindy agent configuration for automating the workflow.
- `docs/dev/changelog.md` – Keep a chronological log of changes.

Feel free to fork or clone this repository and adapt the workflow for your own projects.
