# Proposed Enhancements for Sticky‑to‑Ship Workflow

This document captures proposed enhancements to extend the Sticky‑to‑Ship workflow. These ideas were brainstormed with GitHub Copilot and represent potential features to improve ideation, planning, and execution.

## 1. Idea Voting & Prioritization
Allow community or team members to submit ideas and vote on them. The most popular ideas surface to the top for action, helping prioritize tasks based on collective interest.

## 2. Automated Task Breakdown Generator
Convert selected ideas into actionable tasks by automatically generating user stories and tasks. This would move projects from high‑level concept to a structured set of tasks.

## 3. Integrated Kanban Board
Embed a Kanban board (e.g., using GitHub Projects or a custom UI) within the repository to visualize ideas, tasks, and shipping status. This board would allow easy drag‑and‑drop of tasks through stages like "Backlog," "In Progress," and "Done."

## 4. Brainstorming Session Scheduler
Provide a scheduling tool to organise brainstorming sessions, including agenda templates. Automatically generate issues or notes based on the session outcomes.

## 5. Idea‑to‑Issue Automation
Create a mechanism to convert new ideas into pre‑filled GitHub issues with labels and assignments automatically. This reduces manual overhead when moving from brainstorming to tracking work.

## 6. Progress Milestone Notifications
Send automatic notifications (e.g., via Slack, email, or GitHub comments) when ideas move through stages, such as when an idea is ready for development or when a feature is shipped.

## 7. Feedback & Retrospective Collector
After shipping, prompt teams for feedback and retrospective notes, and store the insights centrally. This encourages continuous improvement and knowledge sharing.

## 8. Template Library for Common Project Types
Offer a library of ready‑made templates (issue templates, PR templates, workflow configurations) for common product types, such as web apps or APIs. These templates speed up the setup of new projects.

## 9. Auto‑Assign Subject Matter Experts
Suggest or automatically assign subject matter experts to guide ideas based on tags or content. This ensures the right people are involved early.

## 10. Sticky‑to‑Ship Analytics Dashboard
Provide analytics on idea throughput, average time from brainstorm to ship, and team contributions. The dashboard can help identify bottlenecks and highlight areas for improvement.
